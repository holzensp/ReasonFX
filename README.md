ReasonFX
========

JavaFX-based theorem prover for logic, mostly about the GUI-design.

The project does not add much to the field of theorem provers.
It's design should allow for easy inclusion of first, second and some higher order logics.
The basis is natural deduction, using Ja≈õkowski notation, but the notation may be relaxed in order to exploit multi-touch panels to a greater extent.

This application also serves as a test-case for the TactileAPI-project (https://github.com/Frumbasjt/TactileAPI).
